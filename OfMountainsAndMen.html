							<h1>    </h1>
  							<p>She came for peace. He lit the spark. Her past might burn it all down.</p>
  
  							<p>After a brutal childhood and a heartbreak that nearly destroyed her, Charlie is done with love. 
                  The last few months have left her shattered, and all she wants now is silence. So, she trades pain 
                  for a pair of ranger boots and a fire watch tower deep in Washington’s wilderness. The forest offers 
                  solitude, healing, and a chance to start over.</p>
              
                <p>But peace is a fragile thing.</p>

                <p>Across the valley, another fire tower flickers to life—Skye’s. The forest has been his home since he was
                  old enough to drink, and nothing ever changed… until Charlie arrived. One glimpse of her, and he’s hooked. 
                  Now he’s calling her tower just to hear her voice, watching her light glow through the trees, knowing she’s 
                  the calm he never knew he needed. She may have come to the forest to find peace—but Skye’s determined to be that peace. 
                  And whether she knows it yet or not, she’s going to be his.</p>

                <p>Only, Charlie’s past isn’t ready to let go.</p>
	
  							<p>Her ex, Theo, isn’t willing to give her up without a fight. If crashing back into her life means keeping the love of his life, 
                  he’ll do it—gladly. Even if it means standing between her and Skye. Because in Theo’s mind, Charlie was his first… 
                  and she’s going to be his last.</p>
